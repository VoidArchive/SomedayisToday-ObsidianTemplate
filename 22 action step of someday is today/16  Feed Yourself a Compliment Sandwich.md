- Once that location has been established, enter this as your first compliment:

```ad-note
You’re doing a fantastic job supporting yourself by creating a system for holding on to compliments long-term so that they can be a source of inspiration in times of need. Also, you deserve to hold on to these compliments. You deserve nothing but the best. Well done! — Matthew Dicks
