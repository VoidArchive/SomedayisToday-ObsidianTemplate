> _We must be willing to celebrate each step along the way_.

## Action Plan

Identify the first meaningful step in the pursuit of your creative goal. _Not_ a significant milestone or extraordinary accomplishment. Just a meaningful step.

- For a novelist, this might be the completion of the first draft of a book or even the first chapter.

- For a storyteller, it might be the first performance of a story onstage.

- For a business owner, it might be the hiring of a first employee or an increase in hourly pay or the development of a new logo.

- For an artist, it might be the first purchase of clay. The mounting of canvas on a frame. The first song plucked from the strings of a ukulele.

Before moving on, plan your celebration _now_. When you reach that first meaningful step, how will you celebrate? Once it’s decided, tell three people in your life.

**During this planned celebration, identify the next meaningful step and plan that celebration.**

*Repeat forever.*
