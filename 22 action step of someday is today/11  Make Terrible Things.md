> _Don’t let perfect be the enemy of progress_.

## Action Plan

1. Get a box. Grab one of the many cardboard boxes that likely arrive at your home on a regular basis, or perhaps go to Etsy and purchase something a little more substantial. Label it _Terrible Progress toward Perfection_. Even better, purchase a bulletin board or a shadow box. Label it the same.

2. Whenever you fail — slightly or spectacularly — place a representation of that failure in the box or on display. This might be the actual failure itself, a photo of the failure, or a visual representation of the failure. Find a means of celebrating each addition to your box or bulletin board. Maybe enjoy a slice of ice-cream cake. Send an email and photo to some of your closest friends with the heading “One fewer disaster away from success!” Host a naked dance party. Or maybe take Howard Frank Mosher’s approach and stick a photo of your failure to the side of the barn and open fire with your shotgun.
