> _Keeping an open mind in terms of what your finish line might be is critical to both learning to make something great and making that great something_.

## Action Plan

1. Choose one of your creative pursuits — one that you are working on or one that you envision for your future.

2. Spend five minutes describing what the ideal result of this endeavor would look like. Write, draw, paint, sketch, or outline. Don’t just think. Create a tangible representation of the result of this endeavor.

3. Now imagine every possible permutation of this endeavor, and do the same. Write, draw, paint, sketch, or outline. If your dream is to open a shop called Fancy Panties, possible permutations might include an online shop, a space inside Victoria’s Secret, a company dedicated to the design and manufacture of women’s underwear, a sustainability business modeled after the bra company ThirdLove, a children’s paper-doll cutout book that includes fancy panties, or the licensing of the name Fancy Panties for underwear already on the market.

4. Ask your five smartest friends for the permutations that they can also envision for your project. Include their ideas on the list.

5. Continue to add to this list as you pursue your dream.

6. Post it somewhere prominent as a reminder of what your creative pursuit might ultimately become.

7. Listen to the NPR podcast _How I Built This_. Nearly every episode demonstrates this concept in reality and will give you additional strategies for pivoting, reimagining, or reinventing.
