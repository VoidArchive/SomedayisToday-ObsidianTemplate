> _As creative people, we must be the collectors, the preservers, and whenever possible, the transformers and expanders of our ideas and content. We need to be supremely flexible in terms of how we view the path of our creative life and the things that we make_.

## Action Plan

This plan requires the list of people whom you assembled in [[13  Find Your People]] . You can email them, schedule a meeting on Zoom, or even make this action plan a part of your [[15  Party Often]] celebration.

Your message will be this:
```

So I’ve made my thing. Opened my Fancy Panties shop. Recorded my polka–yacht rock fusion album. Woven those wicker chairs. Invented a new-and-improved cat litter. Designed and constructed the wedding gown of the future.

Now what?

That’s the question I bring to you, my team of attractive geniuses.

What else can this something be? How can I take the thing I’ve invested enormous amounts of time, energy, and possibly money into and make it something else as well?
```

This step is often hard for the creator to see. Oftentimes it relies on luck and serendipity, which is lovely, but I’m trying to make it purposeful, too, by enlisting the creativity and multitude of experiences of y’all.

Encourage your team to make your something into something else.
