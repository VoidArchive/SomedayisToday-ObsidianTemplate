## Action Plan

1. Make a list of every personal and professional interest you have had since you were a kid. Spend some time making this list. Give yourself a week or more. Ponder the hell out of it.

2. Ask your parents, siblings, and partner for every personal and professional interest that they remember you having or speaking about in your life. Add these items to that list.

3. Post the list in a visible location.

4. Choose the first item to begin studying.

5. Download a podcast, subscribe to a YouTube channel, purchase a book, sign up for lessons, enroll in a class, or join a club related to the chosen subject. Great job! You’ve started something you’ve waited your whole life to begin.

6. Repeat frequently.
