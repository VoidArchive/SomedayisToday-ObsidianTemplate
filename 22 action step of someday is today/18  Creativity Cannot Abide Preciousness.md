> _If you want to make things as desperately as I do, you don’t need picnic baskets full of warm treats, idyllic mountaintop settings, and whiskey-fueled campfires_.

## Action Plan

1. Make a list of all the things you think you need in order to work.

2. Now cross off every item on the list that you don’t actually need.

3. Make a new list of things you _actually_ need in order to work, absent the niceties on the previous list. Post this list in all the places where you might be working.

4. Choose a place where you could never imagine working — your equivalent of a concrete median, beside a barren sapling, in the middle of a parking lot. Some apocalyptic landscape of a creative space. Uncomfortable and unimaginably uninspiring. Go work there for a period of time to prove to yourself that it’s possible.

5. Take a photograph of yourself working in this hellscape. Print a copy and display it someplace prominently, both to remind yourself of what is possible and to let others know how remarkably committed you are to your creative pursuit.
