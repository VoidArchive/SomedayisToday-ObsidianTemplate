> _As a creative person — a maker of things — I know that one of the best ways of developing new ideas, identifying new connections, and expanding my potential skill set is by constantly pursuing new learning in whatever direction my interests may point me. There is no predicting what new bit of knowledge will open a new door and expand your universe, so I simply chase my interests and consume new content, wherever my curiosity takes me_.

One of the best ways for creative people to become more creative is to expand their interests and knowledge across a variety of disciplines. The problem is that people tend to remain in their lane and rarely branch out into new realms. Oftentimes people can’t even see what other realms might be worth exploring.

This is where you come in. Please take an hour, a day, a week, or a month to consider areas of interest and indulgence that you think I should pursue. This could be just about anything:

- A book I might never read

- A film I might never think of seeing

- A sport I should watch or play

- A podcast or YouTube channel that I should dip into

- A board game that I might love

- A person I should meet

- A cuisine I should try

- An interest of yours that you think should also be mine

What am I missing? Tell me. Please. One suggestion would be great. A dozen would be extraordinary.

Thanks so much, my friends.

Warmly,

[Your name]
