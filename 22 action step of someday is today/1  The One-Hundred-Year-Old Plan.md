> _I need to look ahead and ask [the one-hundred-year-old] version of myself — the one who understands the importance and preciousness of time — how I should spend this hour, this day, or this week. He is my trustworthy narrator. He is the one who knows what is best for me_.


## Plan

- Visualizes your one-hundred-year-old-self
- Make the image (Draw, Paint, Edit Photo) and paste it in your mirror.
- Look to the older version of yourself to make critical decisions.
- Let it serve as a reminder that you need the wisdom of the much older version of yourself in order to make the best choices.



## Action 
```ad-note
Paste your image here. And anywhere you are sure to see it everyday. Make it your wallpaper if you have to.
```
