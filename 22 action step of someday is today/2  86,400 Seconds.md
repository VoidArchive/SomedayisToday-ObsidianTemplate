>_I want you to stop thinking about the length of a day in terms of hours and start thinking in terms of minutes. Minutes matter_.

## Plan

- **Determine how many of your minutes are being used well.**
	- From the moment you awaken, begin accounting for your day by tracking each activity and the time in minutes that it takes to complete it. Begin by converting the amount of time you slept into minutes. At the end of the day, subtract the total number of minutes accounted for from 1,440. Your total should be 0.
	- If your subtraction yields more than zero, you’ve spent time in a way you can’t account for, so you need to figure out where.
- **Evaluate the use of your time.**
	- Is there something consistently on the list that should not be on the list because it’s not yielding you anything positive in your life?

	- Are there things in your life that could take less time?

	- Are there things missing from your list that need to be added? More time spent with your cat? A weekly phone call to your sibling? A lot more sex?
