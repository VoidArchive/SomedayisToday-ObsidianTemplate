> 	_Negative people will bring you down. Positive people will lift you up_.

## Action Plan

Make a list of all the people in your life who steal time and energy from you.
For each person, choose one of the four courses of action outlined in the book:
1.Forgiveness
2.Empathy
3.Elimination
4.Enemies list
Take the chosen action for each person.

If an action does not eliminate the drag that the person has on your life, shift to a different strategy. For example, trying to cultivate forgiveness or empathy for a rotten person is a noble choice, but if you find yourself unable, you may simply need to eliminate the person from your life.


## Action 

Horrible person -> Required action

Person A -> Forgiveness
