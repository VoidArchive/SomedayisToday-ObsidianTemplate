> _My proposal is that you begin by increasing your efficiency of sleep. If you’re forced to lie down and render yourself unconscious at least once every day, you should try to do it in the shortest, most restful way possible_.


## Action Plan

**Checklist #1: Standard Sleep Practices**
- [ ] Establish sleep and wake times that fluctuate by less than thirty minutes every day. Weekends and weekday times should be the same. Variation should be minimal.

- [ ] On evenings when you stay out later to enjoy a Springsteen concert, attend a Monday Night Football game at Gillette Stadium, or sneak into the midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, try to keep your wake-up time as close to your regular one as possible, even if this means less sleep. Maintaining a consistent body clock is more important than catching up on two or three hours of lost sleep.

- [ ] Acquire a white-noise machine of some kind and begin using it immediately.

- [ ] Identify the locations in your body where you hold the most tension and relax them one by one before sleep. You can pinpoint these locations by beginning in your toes and working your way to the top of your head, noting places in your body where tightness exists. Once those locations are identified, begin relaxing them first each night.
- [ ] Eliminate the snooze button from your life for the rest of your life.

- [ ] Engage in daily exercise. Begin with a brisk daily walk of ten to fifteen minutes. If a brisk walk is all you ever do in terms of exercise, that’s fine. Fantastic, even. You’re already doing better than most people.

- [ ] Lower your bedroom temperature to sixty-five degrees.

- [ ] Install f.lux on all phones and computers.
- [ ] Set an alarm to go off one hour before bed. When the alarm sounds, stop looking at phones and computers and stop all eating.

- [ ] Whenever possible, take a short, warm shower before bed.



**Checklist #2: The Level-Up Challenge (Only for the Brave of Heart)**

*If you’re serious about treating sleep as sacredly as it deserves to be treated, take these actions as well.*

- [ ] Remove the television from your bedroom. Throw it away if possible.

- [ ] Begin a meditation practice. Download an app, subscribe to a podcast, and/or take a meditation class. Make it a daily practice that you can use in the evening to clear your mind of the terrors of existential dread (or whatever happens to keep you up at night).

- [ ] Stop reading in bed. Stop all activities in bed except for sleeping and sex. If you can move sex to a separate location (or many separate locations), do so. It will help with sleep, and it may improve your sex life, too.
