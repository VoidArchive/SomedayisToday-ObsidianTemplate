> _Time is the most valuable commodity on the planet, and you have just as much of it as the wealthiest people alive. Value it accordingly. Never waste it away_.


## Action Plan

Inventory the apps on your phone. As you take note of each one, consider:

- Is it worthy of your time, or is it robbing you of your most precious commodity?
- Is it moving you in a positive direction and helping you achieve your goals?
- Has your life been better, worse, or about the same since downloading the app?
- Would you be embarrassed if someone found you using the app?

Assign a _yes_ to worthy apps, a _no_ to neutral or mixed-feelings apps, and a _hell no!_ if the app is robbing you of your precious time, failing to move you forward in a positive direction, or making your life worse in some way. Delete the latter apps immediately.
