> _It’s good to know how hard it was for those who came before us_.

## Action Plan

1. Rather than asking what someone does for a living, ask them this: “How did you end up in your current profession?” and “What was the hardest thing that you recently faced professionally?” Make these the questions you ask everyone you meet.

2. If you’re fortunate enough to encounter someone who has found success in your chosen pursuit, ask them to lunch, brunch, dinner, coffee, or a drink. Ask them to tell you their creative story. Record it, if possible.



## Action
- [ ] List out the people who you admire and want to be like
- [ ] Ask them for their creative story
- [ ] If you don't know them, read books/Podcast/Interview
