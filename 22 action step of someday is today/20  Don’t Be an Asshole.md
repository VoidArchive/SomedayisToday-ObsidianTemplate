> _Being an asshole may admittedly get you something in the near term, but creators must play the long game. We need to keep our eyes not on today’s horizon but on the thousands of horizons beyond this one_.

## Action Plan

Seek out at least five people in your life with whom you have a great deal of contact. Try to find people in different settings of your life. People who see you in a variety of contexts and roles.

Engage your team from the previous action plan, too, if you’d like.

I’m engaged in an important creative pursuit, and I need your help. Fear not. It won’t be too hard. It turns out — at least according to the bold and brilliant Matthew Dicks — that being an asshole can be an enormous detriment to my career. But here’s the thing: assholes can’t always see their assholery. So I need you to keep an eye on me. If I’m acting like an asshole to anyone, for any reason, I need you to let me know.


This is serious. Okay?

Also, you might want to purchase a copy of _Someday Is Today_ and _Storyworthy_. Both written by Matthew Dicks. They might change your life.

You can leave that last part off if needed. Or bold it.
