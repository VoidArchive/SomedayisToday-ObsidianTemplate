> _As a creative soul, a maker of things, and a person pursuing your dreams, you can’t afford to be a pessimist_.

## Action Plan

Choose three points in your life:

1. Your most challenging year in school
2. Your most difficult work experience
3. Your most heartbreaking relationship


For each example, make a list of all the things that made that experience especially terrible.
Now ask yourself: _Do any of those things still exist today?_

The goal of this exercise is to remind you that regardless of the mountain of struggle that you currently face, this, too, shall pass.

It’s easy to think that problems linger. Struggles never end. The pit of despair cannot be escaped. This exercise will remind you that you have been in bad spots before, but each time, you have risen above them and moved forward.

You got this.



This too shall pass,
