>_The eagle knows not to invest your most precious resource in things that are ultimately irrelevant. Don’t waste time on things that will mean nothing to you hours or days later. Don’t spend a minute on something that you will forget in an hour. Don’t even think about things over which you have no control_.

## Action Plan

1. Make an honest, ruthless self-appraisal of all the things you do that don’t need to be done.
	- Look for things you think you need to do even though no one else is doing them.
	- Look for things people scoff at you for doing.
	- Look for things that make you feel guilty or silly for doing them.
	- Look for things you do that no one ever notices you do.

These are the places where you can often find wasted steps. Do your best to scrutinize your life carefully. Don’t be kind to yourself.

2. Ask five people who know you best to make a list of all things you do that you don’t need to do. Tell them to be ruthless.

3. Ask the five colleagues who work with you most closely to make a list of all things you do that you don’t need to do. Tell them to be ruthless.

4. If you have a partner, spouse, or roommates, ask them to make a list of all things you do that you don’t need to do. Don’t worry. They will be ruthless already.

Examine the lists. Consider removing any and all items from your life, even if it’s just to see what will happen.

What you will discover is this: the most common reaction other people will have to your shedding an obligation is nothing.

If an item appears on more than one list, you must seriously consider removing it from your life forever. The more you remove, the better off you will be.
