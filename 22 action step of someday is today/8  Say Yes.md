> _The result of that simple yes is remarkable. That yes results in a possibility tree — the branching of new opportunities — of enormous proportions_.

## Action Plan

First, go back to that one-hundred-year-old version of yourself — the one on your mirror, the one dangerously plastered to the windshield of your car, the one that got moldy in the shower.

Then …

1. Grab some Post-it Notes.

2. Cut out a speech bubble for every one of those representations of your one-hundred-year-old self.

3. Write the word _Yes!_ on each Post-it Note speech bubble.

4. Stick it to the image.

From this point forward, whenever you’re asked to engage in a new creative endeavor, your answer is going to be “Yes!” Every opportunity deserves a yes, and every yes deserves at least three days before becoming a no.

After three or more days, if the yes still does not feel right, you may change it to a no.
